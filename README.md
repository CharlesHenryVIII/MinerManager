# MinerManager

MinerManager is a process scanner and exe manager.  MinerManager will stop your mining program when it detects one of the listed processes in the config file.

* Run MinerManager.exe as Admin and then stop it by "Exit"ing the program in the system tray

- [ ] Improve the delay when interacting with UI and it updating the working thread
- [ ] Look for an alternative to updating based on time
